# Random-Fixture

### This web app was one of the first few projects, that I did, and I found it from my old laptop. So, why not post it here?. It's an app created to optimize my game-time.

## Why I made this?

### I generally play a local tournament of FIFA with my friends which includes the elite teams from the world of football/soccer on Xbox/Play Station. So we have this rule of playing with the fixture that we are given and we do not have any choice in selecting any team. So, I thought of optimizing this part, so that, we spend less time on making fixtures and more time in playing the tournament. Thus, I had created this web app to optimize my game-time.
