# Random-Fixture

## Objective:

I generally play local tournaments of Fifa on Xbox with my friends. So we have this rule of playing with fixture that we are given and we don't have any choice in selecting any team and creating fixtures is a pain. So, I thought of optimizing this part, so that, we spend less time on making fixtures and more time in playing the tournament. Thus, I had created this web-app in order to optimize my game time.
