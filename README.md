# Random-Fixture
This was one of my first few projects that I did and I found it from my old laptop. So, thought of posting it here. It's an app created to optimize my game-time.

## Objective:

I generally play a local tournament of fifa with my friends which includes the elite teams from the world of football/soccer on Xbox. So we have this rule of playing with the fixture that we are given and we don't have any choice in selecting any team and creating fixtures is a pain. So, I thought of optimizing this part, so that, we spend less time on making fixtures and more time in playing the tournament. Thus, I had created this web-app in order to optimize my game-time.
